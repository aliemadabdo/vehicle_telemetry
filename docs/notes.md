### Approach:
- First we have thinked about the architecture and how each component interact with each other.
- Second we implemented the abstract class Sensor which will be a parent for every sensor [Inheritance].
- We have devided each class into header and cpp files.
-  

### Notes and Questions [To Be Revised]
- Its not modular to take the sensor range with object instansiation.
- It may be better to handle this operation internally for each sensor class in a separet thread
